2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
   - Rename and transform columns for clarity
   - Export cleaned data for database integration

3. **Database Connection (SQL Integration)**
   - Create a new database in **MySQL / PostgreSQL / MS SQL Server**
   - Use Python to connect and load the cleaned data into the SQL database
   - Run `customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql` to answer key business questions

4. **Data Analysis (SQL Queries)**
   - Analyze customer segments, retention, loyalty, and purchase patterns
   - Perform aggregations, joins, and subqueries to extract business insights

5. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**
   - Connect the SQL database to Power BI
   - Build a dynamic and interactive **customer behavior dashboard**
   - Visualize KPIs, revenue trends, and customer engagement metrics

6. **Report & Presentation**
   - Summarize key findings, insights, and recommendations in a report
   - Create a presentation deck (using **Gamma AI / PowerPoint**)
